## How It Works

1. **Boot Sequence:**  
   When the page loads, simulated system logs appear such as  
   _“Initializing Mr Matt System…” → “System Online.”_

2. **Profile Reveal:**  
   After a brief boot animation, the card fades in with smooth transitions.

3. **Live Time:**  
   The display updates every second to show current time dynamically.

4. **Responsive Behavior:**  
   The layout adapts beautifully across all device sizes without distortion.
